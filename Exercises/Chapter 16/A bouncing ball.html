A bouncing ball

Use the requestAnimationFrame technique that we saw in Chapter 13 and Chapter 15 to draw a box with a bouncing ball in it. The ball moves at a constant speed and bounces off the box’s sides when it hits them.

<canvas width="400" height="400"></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");

  var lastTime = null;
  function frame(time) {
    if (lastTime != null)
      updateAnimation(Math.min(100, time - lastTime) / 1000);
    lastTime = time;
    requestAnimationFrame(frame);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
	
  var distance = 50;
  function updateAnimation(step) {
    distance +=1;
    drawCicle(distance,50);
    //cx.clearRect(distance, 50, 500, 500);
  }
  function drawCicle(posX,posY){
    //cx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    cx.beginPath();
    cx.arc(posX, posY, 40, 0, 7);
    cx.fillStyle = "red";
    cx.fill();
    cx.stroke(); 
  }
</script>

[hint]

A box is easy to draw with strokeRect. Define a variable that holds its size or define two variables if your box’s width and height differ. To create a round ball, start a path, call arc(x, y, radius, 0, 7), which creates an arc going from zero to more than a whole circle, and fill it.

To model the ball’s position and speed, you can use the Vector type from Chapter 15(which is available on this page). Give it a starting speed, preferably one that is not purely vertical or horizontal, and every frame, multiply that speed with the amount of time that elapsed. When the ball gets too close to a vertical wall, invert the x component in its speed. Likewise, invert the y component when it hits a horizontal wall.

After finding the ball’s new position and speed, use clearRect to delete the scene and redraw it using the new position.
